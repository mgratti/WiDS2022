The notebook [wids_dataexploration.ipynb](wids_dataexploration.ipynb) includes some initial exploration of the dataset with detailed considerations about each existing feature. Notebook [wids_considerations.ipynb](wids_considerations.ipynb) contains reasoning about the found solution. The solution is then exposed in [wids_challenge.ipynb](wids_challenge.ipynb).
