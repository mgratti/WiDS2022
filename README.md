# WiDS Datathon: prediction of building Energy Intensity

The challenge focuses on predicting the **energy intensity** of buildings in the USA starting from observations of energy usage records, building and climate information, collected over **7 years** in several states.

The notebook [wids_dataexploration.ipynb](wids_dataexploration.ipynb) includes some initial exploration of the dataset as well as reasoning over a first solution, which is then exposed in [wids_challenge.ipynb](wids_challenge.ipynb).
